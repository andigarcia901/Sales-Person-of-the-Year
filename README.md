I found this project to be more indepth than the first SQL project I did.  The JOIN querying was my biggest challenge in this project.  As I worked through the project, insights into the data started appearing such as the strategies salespersons were using to be top performing.  I listed some other insights below:

1. Who was the top salesperson for the year?
        Dirk would be salesperson for the year.

2. How much better did the top salesperson do than the individual who came in second for the year?
        Dirk sold more than twice what the second individual sold for the year.

3. Was there any relationship between the average sale amount for the top salespersons and the total sales?
        Although Dirk had a higher average sale amount, Michel had a higher total sales.

4. How do you think the top selling salesperson gained so many sales? What was their strategy?

- Did they sell to many customers, or a dedicated few?
- Did they tend to sell a few big ticket (high priced) items, or did they focus on a high volume of lower priced items?
        Dirk's strategy seemed to be selling the highest priced item and he was able to sell that multiple times to the same customer.  
 

5. What was the top selling product for the year? What was the lowest selling? (For both dollar amount sold and quantity sold).
        The top selling product by dollar amount is the Mountain -100 Silver, 38 but the Road-350-W-Yellow, 42 had the highest quantity sold.
        The lowest selling product was the Adjustable Race with a quantity of 10 and a dollar amount of 1.6. 

6. What problems did you find in the data? (For example, where there any products without a price?)
        There were products without a price which could effect the data for the dollar amount of the lowest selling item - Depending on if you limit the queries.



## QUERY PROBLEMS

1. Using JOINs in a single query, combine data from all three tables (employees, products, sales) to view all sales with complete employee and product information in one table.

2. Create a View for the query you made in Problem 1 named "all_sales"

3. Test your View by selecting all rows and columns from the View

4. Find the average sale amount for each sales person

5. Find the top three sales persons by total sales

6. Find the product that has the highest price

7. Find the product that was sold the most times

8. Using a subquery, find all products that have a price higher than the average price for all products

9. Find the customer who spent the most money in purchased products

10. Find the total number of sales for each sales person

11. Find the sales person who sold the most to the customer you found in Problem 8
